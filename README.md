### 🎯 Vision
Our vision is to build a smart, concise tool that helps students and professionals write industry-standard code. Whether it's fixing a missing semicolon in C++ or suggesting better variable names in Python, Clarity guides you toward cleaner, more professional code.

### 💡 The Core Idea
**Clarity** is more than just a debugger. It is a multi-language Code Correction and Suggestion engine. 

Students often write code that "works" but uses poor practices (like variables named `a`, `b`, `x`). Clarity analyzes the code and suggests **industry-standard improvements**.

**Example (Naming Suggestion):**

**Input Code (Working, but poor style):**
```python
def c(x, y):
    return x * y
```

**Clarity's Output (Professional Standard):**
```python
def calculate_area(length, width):
    return length * width
```

It also handles standard bug fixes (syntax errors, missing brackets) across languages like **Python, C++, Java, and JavaScript**, without the fluff of massive chatbots.

### 🤝 Our Team Approach
This is a learning project. We don't have separate "frontend" or "backend" teams. Everyone is encouraged to work across the entire stack to gain experience with all parts of the application, from the UI to the AI model.

### 💻 Technology Stack
The project will utilize the following technologies:

| Component          | Technology                  | Purpose                               |
| ------------------ | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **Machine Learning** | Python, PyTorch, Hugging Face | For the core AI code correction model |
| **Backend API**    | Python, FastAPI             | For serving the AI model              |
| **Frontend UI**    | HTML, CSS, JavaScript       | For the user interface                |
